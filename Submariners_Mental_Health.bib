  abstract = {Objective: Not perceiving circadian shifts of sunlight due to living in enclosed environments may have deleterious effects on mental health and plasma parameters. This study aimed to determine the effect of dim regulation on the submarine personnel of Iranian Navy forces by radiating devices according to natural circadian sunlight shifts. Also, this study aimed to investigate the impact of mimicking sunlight circadian by artificial radiance luminating devices on the serological and psychological measures of submarine personnel. ,  Method : Participants were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups in this non-randomized controlled trial. There were 26 participants in each group, and they were all male aged 21-29 years. Both groups were living in the submarine underground hall, with 120 meters 2 area with constant radiance with the same intensity. The experimental group had been given extra lighting devices with changing radiance intensity according to the natural sunlight circadian cycles. Plasma melatonin levels and depression and anxiety scores were determined before and after the experiment for both groups. Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) and Cattell’s Anxiety Scale Questionnaire (IPAT) were used to measure depression and anxiety, respectively.,  Results: Findings indicate that the plasma melatonin levels (-16.2±13.6 vs 8.0±9.3 mg/dL, respectively; p{$<$}0.001), depression scores (-6±6 vs 3.9±5.4, respectively; p{$<$}0.001), and anxiety scores (-1±1.2 vs 0.73±1.04, respectively; p{$<$}0.001) significantly reduced in the experimental group compared to the control group.,  Conclusion: Using radiance dimmers, with a radiance intensity regularity according to the sunlight, is effective in improving psychiatric and plasma parameters and can be used in closed occupational environments such as underground environments and submarine halls.},

  abstract = {Among other missions, Legal Medicine aims to diagnose torture, as a means of contributing to judicial investigations and repair victims. In Uruguay, several administrative and criminal procedures are developed in connection to the times of state terrorism (between June 27, 1973 and February 28, 1985). Despite torture being an indescribable crime against humanity, it was typified in Act 18,026 of September 26, 2006. National jurisprudence has dismissed its classification in the cases that occurred during the times of state terrorism, based on the non-retroactivity principle of criminal law. Simultaneously, the Prosecutor's Office Specialized in Crimes Against Humanity has requested several reports in connection with the possibility that torture methods applied by State terrorism in Uruguay may have caused severe or very severe lesions. General objective: to contribute to learning about state terrorist crimes in Uruguay, thus contributing to the creation of international standards for truth, justice, memory and repair. Sspecific objectives: 1. To describe the torture methods applied. 2. To determine their ability to cause severe or very severe lesions. Method: the study was based on national history investigations, as well as jurisprudence in the field, review of international bibliography, pathophysiology of similar situtaions and current national consensus on fact assumptions included in the criminal classification of severe and very severe lesions. Results: the times of state terrorism in Uruguay have been characterized by the application of large scale torture in a systematic way. The most frequently used methods were hooding, restriction of water, food and rest, exposure to the cold, beating up, including "the phone", sitting in, hanging, vaults, wet and dry submarine, electric shock baton and sexual assaults. The different methods of physical torture include psychological suffering. By means of specific mechanisms, they are all useful to cause harm that lie within several assumptions of severe and very severe harm crimes. I pregnant women, all of these methods of torture are effective to interrupt pregnancy or anticipate delivery. Conclusions: there is a pattern in the systematic methods of torture used by state terrorism, which included methods involving omissions, positions, trauma, and electrical shocks and, suffocating. All of them may result in one or more of the assumptions included in the severe or very severe lesions crimes. Risk of life and psychological consequences inherent to torture. In pregnant women, all the methods of torture described are effective to interrupt the pregnancy or anticipate delivery.},

From this island, few microbiological studies have been performed, and the presence of archaea has not been reported. In order to investigate the archaeal diversity in hydrothermalism from Deception Island, different submarine samples were taken from the flooded caldera. Samples were analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of the 16S rRNA gene in conjunction with culture-dependent methods at hyperthermophilic temperatures. Analysis from DGGE band sequencing showed the presence of archaea belonging to the hyperthermophilic genus Thermococcus and different uncultured archaea closely related to environmental clones from hydrothermal vents. Archaea from the psychrotolerant genus Methanococcoides were also detected. Additionally, we have successfully isolated an anaerobic hyperthermophilic archaeon closely related to Thermococcus celericrescens. Cells were irregular cocci with a diameter between 0.6 and 2 mu m and grew at 50-90 A degrees C and at a NaCl concentration of 1-5 \%. Here, we present, based on culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches, the first report on archaea from marine hydrothermal sites of Antarctica.},

This environment is known to degrade submariners' mood and cognition. Methods This exploratory, empirical study followed a cohort of 24 volunteer submariners. Dispositional mindfulness was assessed with the Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory, in order to identify two groups (mindful and non-mindful) and compare change in emotional state, interoception, and health behaviors during the patrol. Results Overall, psychological health deteriorated during the patrol. However, mindful submariners demonstrated better psychological adaptation and interoception than the non-mindful group. This was associated with better subjective health behaviors (sleeping and eating). Conclusions Dispositional mindfulness appears to protect against the negative effects of long-term containment in a professional environment, such as a submarine patrol. Our work highlights that mindfulness may help individuals to cope with stress in such situations. Developing mindfulness could also be an important preventive healthcare measure during quarantine imposed by the outbreak of a serious infectious disease.},

Introduction: Although submarine accidents occur rarely, they sometimes result in many casualties. Although there are numerous reports on behavioral health consequences following surface vessel accidents, few studies have focused on these issues in the unique context of submarines. This paper reviews the history of significant acknowledged submarine accidents and reports the results of a behavioral health assessment following one recent accident. Methods: In 2007, a French nuclear-powered submarine (SNA Rubis) suffered a collision during a diving exercise off Toulon, France. All of the crew were individually assessed by a psychiatric team following the event for defusing. A follow-up assessment by auto-questionnaire was only conducted 8 mo after the accident using an anonymous subjective survey tool, the French version of the post-traumatic checklist scale (PCLS). Results: Of the 50 male crew, 48 (average age 28.8 +/- 4.3 yr) completed the questionnaire. Most of the crew (95.8\%) had talked about the accident with close relations or work colleagues, but only three discussed it with a doctor. Median PCLS score was 19 (range 17-45); 83.3\% of the crew had scores 29; one subject met the criteria for PTSD. Discussion: Whether or not PTSD is an occupational hazard in submariners, this report high ights the difficulties in conducting behavioral health follow-up after serious accidents.},

  abstract = {Aims: The aim was to create a more challenging version of the Picture Naming and Immediate Recall test (PICNIR) to verify the difficulty of naming 20 strictly selected pictures by patients with cognitive impairments, to provide clear rules for the correct evaluation of their naming, and to specify the test administration rules. We refer to it as to the so-called door version according to the first picture. Methods: Twenty more difficult pictures were named using a written or electronic form by 5,625 ordinary citizens from all over the Czech Republic with a wide age and educational range and by more than 100 patients with a diverse spectrum of cognitive impairment from our previous studies. Name agreement was determined by the correct naming of these pictures. Then, name variants of each picture were categorized into two groups of correct and incorrect names. The categorization of the 15 remaining questionable names for the 12 pictures was assessed in an electronic questionnaire and voted on by 110 pharmacists, neurologists, speech therapists, psychologists, psychiatrists, and other people. Results: First, we determined that the naming of the images matched the expected naming. High name agreement of the selected 20 pictures with the expected name was above 90\% (97\% on average) in ordinary citizens, and conversely, lower or no name agreement was desirable in patients with various cognitive disorders (76\% on average) based on our several previous studies. Names of the following categories will be considered as correct: synonyms (traffic lights - lights), diminutives (robot - small robot), multiword name containing the expected name (cake with candle), subordinate name (submarine - bathyscaphe), and other categories or names (cloverleaf - clover). Names of the following categories will be considered as incorrect: semantic paragraphia (door - window, fork - brush, pie - button, stamp - painting, cake - cemetery, waterfall - weir, chessboard - chess), graphemic changes (globe - globus), multiword name without the expected name (magnifier - magnifying glass, cake - Stalin ' s monument, waterfall - water stream), more general names (Eskimo - Northerner), approximate term (fence - planks), plurals (traffic light - traffic lights), and names of words without diacritics (jerab - jerab). Conclusion: Correct and incorrect names of appropriately selected 20 more difficult pictures were defined and categorized into several subgroups to evaluate picture naming consistently and unambiguously in the more demanding door PICNIR test.},

  abstract = {Submariners face many challenges. For example, they "live where they work" and can be called to duty anytime. They have limited access to open space, natural settings, fresh air, fresh food, sunlight, privacy, exercise, and outside communication. They support a wider range of missions than occur aboard most other Navy vessels. At sea or on shore, submariners work long hours under conditions with little margin for error. They may traverse remote or disputed areas of the ocean far from rescue assets, and must remain vigilant for potential encounters with hostile forces, onboard fires, anomalies in the breathing atmosphere, leaks, undersea collisions, or radiation exposures. If any of these factors cause casualties, the Independent Duty Corpsman (with intermittent advice from shore-based medical personnel), must be ready to provide aid as long as necessary. The challenges of submarine service led to the growth of the unique field of submarine medicine, which has maintained an excellent record of health and safety. This review introduces the field of submarine medicine as practiced in the U.S. Navy, describing its major concerns, giving an overview of the operation of a submarine medical department, and identifying several medical gaps that researchers are working to fill. Submarine medicine already has a stellar record in terms of radiation and atmospheric safety and has made strides in fatigue management. Ongoing work will deliver improved psychological screening and support tools. This report summarizes developments in these and other areas of submarine medicine.},

In this work, we present a method for obtaining these properties from the multi-fluid mixture formulation of the GERG mixture model. This mixture model was originally developed to model the thermodynamics of natural gas mixtures, and more recently has been extended to model thermodynamic properties relevant for carbon capture and storage. The primary advantage of this formulation is that the dry air composition is not fixed, and can be adjusted to suit the application, for instance for combustion flue gases, for air in submarines, for Martian atmospheres, etc. Furthermore, this multi-fluid framework employs the highest accuracy pure-fluid equations of state in the literature. We present algorithms that can be used to calculate the quantity of water in the saturated vapor in vapor-liquid and solid-vapor equilibria, and other properties that arise out of these equilibria calculations, such as relative humidity and humidity ratio. We also present algorithms for converting other common sets of independent variables (e.g., wet-bulb temperatures), to the natural variables of the mixture model. Comprehensive discussion of the developed algorithms is provided, as well as sample code in the C++ language. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Results: At 7 months, 9.1\% met criteria for PTSD and none met criteria for depression. Higher levels of depressive symptoms were associated with previous traumatic exposures, subsequent life events, and higher levels of PTSD symptoms; higher levels of PTSD symptoms were associated with greater peritraumatic dissociation and initial emotional response. Conclusion: Acute exposures of highly trained professionals to potentially fatal events may not result in high levels of posttraumatic symptoms. Previous and subsequent life events may play a more significant role in the level of postdisaster symptoms.},

  abstract = {Background: Submarine operations require strict adherence to standard operating and safety procedures and errors in judgement or accidents could lead to catastrophe and impair the submarine's ability to surface. In case of disablement of a submarine (DISSUB), the crew would have to survive inside the submarine for a variable period awaiting rescue. Microclimate and habitability of the submarine would have to be maintained and crew would have to consume emergency rations and water. Methods: In order to validate these procedures, a simulation was carried out in which 80 crew members were closed up inside a submarine in harbour for 24 h simulating a DISSUB situation without power and ventilation. Results: Average temperature of the submarine compartments rose from 29.33 °C at the beginning of the simulation to 33.5 °C at the end of 24 h. Relative humidity increased from 79\% to 87.67\%. Crew members consumed an average to 973 kcal worth of rations during the 24 h of the exercise with 500 ml water. Conclusion: Submarine crew could survive successfully inside a disabled submarine awaiting rescue if thermal stress could be addressed. In the present simulation, the crew suffered from effects of thermal stress. Thermal stress would not only affect damage control capabilities, but could also lead the crew into earlier escape. Greater research and further studies are required to mitigate thermal stress and its effects in order to prolong survival.},

  abstract = {The challenge to effectively evaluating teams in extreme environments necessarily involves a wide range of physiological, psychological, and psychosocial factors. The high reliance on technology, the growing frequency of multinational and multicultural teams, and the demand for longer duration missions all further compound the complexity of the problem. The primary goal is the insurance of human health and wellbeing with expectations that such priorities will naturally lead to improved chances for performance and mission success. This paper provides an overview of some of the most salient immediate challenges for selecting, training, and supporting teams in extreme environments, gives exemplars of research findings concerning these challenges, and discusses the need for future research.},

  abstract = {Current psychological and sociocultural considerations for Moon and Mars bases are embedded within a complex matrix of long duration issues that have been demonstrated to significantly impact on human behavior and performance in challenging environments characterized by isolation and confinement. Planning for psychological health for long duration inhabitation missions rather than short duration task accomplishment profiles is further complicated by the need to address both flight issues as well as station issues. The fundamental problem today in developing effective countermeasures for long duration missions is the fact that space missions are not truly psychologically comparable to any other undertaking humans have ever attempted (e.g., long-duration stays on orbital space stations, historical expeditions to unknown parts of the Earth, wintering-over in Antarctica, long-term submergence in submarines) differing most notably in the enormous distance to travel, the unique separation from the rest of humanity and the extraordinary demands of an environment characterized by the lack of any fundamental environmental factor (e.g., air, water, gravity) heretofore required for survival. Mission scenarios call for crewmembers to endure extraordinary long periods of extreme confinement and isolation compounded with the absence of normal sensory input that would regulate psychological and physiological functioning. Increased known psychological risks related to individual performance, behavioral health and crew interactions will be magnified by completely new unpredictable psychological challenges under these extraordinary conditions of isolation and confinement from the rest of humanity. A broad spectrum of social psychological and behavioral research has contributed to the emerging realization that many of the negative psychological factors of long duration Moon/Mars missions (e.g., prolonged isolation, confinement, exposure to unpredictable and unknown extreme environment, reliance on closed loop environmental system) could be mitigated by designing habitats that thoughtfully countered some of these impacts. The intersection of psychology and psychosocial factors with habitat design allows us to implement psychological support in non-intrusive, holistic environmental modalities that are preventive in orientation rather than palliative. The present paper discusses those psychological factors with mission structure or design implications that can be addressed by a thoughtful and proactive implementation of psychological and psychosocial support systems and countermeasure environmental elements, including enabling technologies on the horizon that would significantly contribute to the successful psychological adaptation of long duration space inhabitants.},

  abstract = {This study aimed to identify work-related and personal factors associated with occupational stress in submariners. Work and well-being questionnaires were distributed to 219 male submariners (mean age 34 years), as part of a larger cohort study involving a stratified sample of 4951 Royal Navy (RN) personnel. The stress rate in submariners was 40\%; significantly higher than the stress rate in the general RN, although once demographic factors were controlled for in a matched control sample, this difference was no longer significant. A summary model accounted for 49\% of the variance in submariner stress, with key differences emerging between the occupational factors associated with stress in submariners and in the general RN. The longitudinal nature of this study permits stress in submariners to be monitored over 5 years, which will provide valuable insights into the chronicity of stress in this specialised occupational group. STATEMENT OF RELEVANCE: This paper contributes to the current literature on the negative impact of working in isolated conditions. It is demonstrated that occupational stress in submarines can be partially explained using current theories of stress in the workplace. However, the constraints of a restricted environment introduce additional factors which can also be associated with occupational stress.},

  abstract = {Background: Submariners are an occupational group within the Royal Navy (RN) who work in isolated and extreme conditions. This preliminary study forms part of a longitudinal study of occupational stress in the RN. Aims: To compare stress prevalence in submariners with matched controls and to identify predictors of occupational stress in submariners over a 2 year follow-up period. Methods: Participants completed a Work and Well-Being Questionnaire to measure occupational stressors and the General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12) to measure stress at time point 1, and a follow-up GHQ-12 2 years later. Demographically matched controls from the surface fleet of the RN were identified for each submariner. Regression models were developed for submariners and their controls to predict future stress at time point 2 using psychosocial predictors from time point 1. Results: Participants comprised 144 submariners and 144 general service controls. There were no differences between submariners and their surface fleet counterparts in the prevalence of occupational stress. Nevertheless, different predictors for the development of stress were found between the two groups. For submariners, over-commitment and rank were the main predictors; whereas for controls, the predictors were length of service, body mass index and physical work. Conclusions: Submariners were not more likely to suffer from occupational stress than surface fleet controls in the RN. However, the psychosocial predictors of stress were significantly different for this RN specialist group, demonstrating the importance of developing individual models of stress for different occupational groups. © Crown copyright 2012.},

Bigelow foregrounds the inner, individual experiences of characters within ensembles and institutions, 'the lonely walk' affording a useful way to visualise the action of isolated characters in danger. Bigelow's use of spatial relationships to convey the inner lives of characters is an unorthodox mode for action films. In Point Break, this aesthetic/formal approach is associated with philosophy, psychology, and judicial law. Bigelow stages the plot, of an FBI agent getting drawn into the lifestyle of bank robbers, in a series of face-offs leading towards transcendence of the laws that define most cops-and-robbers films. K-19: The Widowmaker, an adaptation of a real-life Soviet submarine disaster, also contains a face-off between men with contrasting philosophies. Again, Bigelow accentuates individual action, as each man faces his own walk towards radiation poisoning. In The Hurt Locker, the central character and his harrowing missions are defined by his rogue single-mindedness. He is an impenetrable action hero, but under Bigelow's direction, that status is one that occurs from the inside out. Finally, in historical drama Detroit, Bigelow's attention to individual volition shifts to characters that lack freedom and equal treatment.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: In this study, we aimed to understand how active duty service members and their partners navigate the infertility care process within the Military Health System (MHS) while managing a military career. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We obtained Institutional Review Board approval to employ a qualitative design using grounded theory methods. We recruited participants using purposive sampling, followed by theoretical sampling. We derived data from demographic questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. Consistent with grounded theory methods, we began analysis with line-by-line coding and moved to focused coding. We employed constant comparative analysis throughout the process to name, categorize, and conceptualize data and relationships. RESULTS: The participants included 28 patients, five partners, nine health care providers, and two military leaders. The infertility care process began with active duty service members and their partners recognizing the desire to have a child and discovering infertility, followed by deciding to seek infertility care. The experience was temporally bound within the context of the military environment. We identified the following themes, which described facilitators and barriers to accessing care: Duty station location, career stage, military versus the civilian cost of services, command climate, and policy. These facilitators and barriers varied widely across the Department of Defense (DoD), which resulted in fragmented and inconsistent care cycles, contributed to emotional and physical stress, and created tension between career progression and family formation. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding how military couples perceive and manage demands of infertility care may enhance access to care, decrease patient costs, improve outcomes, result in better support for military couples who experience infertility, and ultimately improve the health and military readiness of our armed forces. The results support the need for action by providers, policy makers, and military leaders to develop effective infertility treatment programs and policies in the DoD.},

Hyperthermia and hypothermia are just two of the adverse conditions that they can experience. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of two models of submarine escape and the protective capabilities of immersion suits from environmental changes. Method: A randomized study involving 24 male subjects was conducted to compare the thermal capabilities of the full- versus half-configuration suit in a climate-controlled chamber. Results: The full-configuration suits tested for a higher mean maximal core temperature (37.76°C / 99.97°F) than the mean maximal core temperature of the half-suits (37.52°C / 99.54°F). The full suits also tested for a higher mean minimal core temperature (36.13°C / 97.03°F) than the mean minimal core temperature (35.95°C / 96.71°F) of the half-suits. Conclusion: Results showed that the full-suit configuration did not induce clinically significant high levels of heat stress as compared to the half-suits, but instead provided better thermal protection against hypothermia than the half-suits.

  abstract = {CNS O2 toxicity (CNS-OT) seizures are the limiting factor when breathing hyperbaric O2 in diving \& submarine medicine. O2-induced seizures are the result of oxidative and nitrosative stress that lead to CNS hyperexcitability. The risk for CNS-OT increases during CO2 retention. The cSC is an important cardiorespiratory integrative center that is stimulated during both HA \& hyperoxia. The stimulatory effects of O2 \& CO2 on cellular excitability suggests these molecules modulate one another in the CNS-OT mechanism. We have tested the following hypotheses in rat brain slices: 1) hyperoxia (95\%O2) increases the production of reactive O2 \& N2 species (RO/NS) in cSC cells (control O2, 40\%), and 2) addition of HA exacerbates the rate of RO/NS production. We also investigated the effects of CO2-anesthesia on RO/NS production during subsequent administration of HA \& hyperoxia. Fluorescence microscopy was used to measure the production rates of superoxide ( O2-), nitric oxide ( NO), and an aggregate pool of RO/NS (ONOO-, NO2, CO3-) as the slope of fluorescence intensity (ΔFI/min). Results show the ΔFI/min of O2- and NO increased during hyperoxia, but were only seen in the presence of NOS and SOD inhibitors or SOD mimetics, respectively. Addition of HA increased the ΔFI/min of the aggregate pool, but only during hyperoxia. The effects of HA during hyperoxia are greater when CO2 anesthesia is not used prior to tissue harvesting. We conclude that 1) hyperoxia produces an enhanced redox and nitrosative environment for cSC neurons, 2) HA exacerbates downstream RO/NS production in an O2-dependent manner, and 3) use of CO2 anesthesia before euthanasia may blunt the effects of HA.

After 2 control days and 1 d of hypoxia, the remaining environmental conditions were imposed for the next 5 d, followed by 1 additional day of just hypoxia. Daily morning symptoms were assessed using the Environmental Symptoms Questionnaire (ESQ). Postural stability was determined on 4 occasions using a computerized balance system: control period, after 2.7 and 4.7 d of steady-state test conditions, and after 5.7 d (with return to normal ambient temp, RH, and CO2). Three balance tests were performed: eyes open, eyes closed, and a dynamic test. Postural stability deteriorated after 2.7 d (87\% eyes open, P {$<$} 0.001 and 26\% eyes closed, P = 0.01). ESQ symptom subsets for acute mountain sickness, exertion, fatigue, alertness, and ear/nose/throat were not significantly different. Cold symptom subsets were increased after 3-7 d (P {$<$} 0.001); distress and muscle discomfort subsets after 7 d (P = 0.02). Continued exposure to the combination of cold and hypoxia elicited subjective symptom changes and disturbances in postural stability that are statistically significant. These observations may be of practical importance when tasks aboard a disabled submarine involve balance and mobility.},

Previous investigations on their microbial diversity mostly targeted low energy beaches, lacked seasonality or geochemical information. We now have used a multidisciplinary approach to study the microbial diversity within sediments of a sandy, high energy beach that additionally exhibits submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) in the intertidal. We sampled two transects at three seasons down to a depth of one meter for 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and subsequent correlation of microbial diversity to physico-chemical parameters. We found that advection driven transport of porewater constituents and constant physical reworking of the sediments prevented a distinct formation of vertically stratified redox zones. Consequently, a uniform microbial core community of generalists established independently of sampling site and depth. During spring, the community structure was disturbed by a "subsurface bloom" of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, probably due to deeper oxygen and nitrate penetration depths. In summer, the community returned to its equilibrium state with imprints of the subsurface bloom still visible. In our study, we did not detect a clear impact of SGD on microbial diversity, but found an unexpected homogeneous composition and resilience of the microbial community structure.},

METHODS: A prospective study was conducted in 2010 during two missions aboard nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines. Over a 6-month follow-up, the study subjects completed five standardized questionnaires (Fagerström test, Hospital Anxiety Depression, and the Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale). RESULTS: Out of 222 prospective study subjects, 168 were included, 52 of whom were smokers. For 84.9\% of the smokers, the Fagerström test score was lower than 2 (no dependency). Additionally, 92\% of the smokers did not experience withdrawal symptoms following an abrupt and mandatory cessation of cigarette smoking. Two-thirds of the smokers resumed their addiction within 2 months, 78\% of whom did so the first day they had the opportunity. CONCLUSIONS: In the physically and mentally constraining environment of submarines, the behavioral component of cigarette dependency largely dominates over the psychological and physical components of nicotine dependence. This phenomenon occurs because the behavioral component of addiction is the source of smoking resumption and, therefore, must be better addressed to achieve sustained withdrawal.},

  abstract = {Submarine watch-standers adhere to a 6 hour-on, 12 hour-off (6/12) watch-standing schedule, yoking them to an 18-hr day, engendering circadian desynchronization and chronic sleep deprivation. Moreover, the chronic social crowding, shift work, and confinement of submarine life provide additional stressors known to correlate with elevated secretory immunoglobulin A (slgA) and cortisol levels, reduced performance, immunologic dysfunction, malignancies, infections, gastrointestinal illness, coronary disease, anxiety, and depression. We evaluated an alternative, compressed, fixed work schedule designed to enhance circadian rhythm entrainment, sleep hygiene, performance, and health on 10 underway submariners, who followed the alternative and 6/12 schedules for approximately 2 weeks each. We measured subjects' sleep, cognitive performance, and salivary biomarker levels. Pilot analysis of the salivary data on one subject utilizing ELISA suggests elevated biomarker levels of stress. Average PM cortisol levels were 0.2 mu g/L (normal range: nondetectable - 0.15 mu g/L), and mean slgA levels were 5 62 mu g/ml (normal range: 100-500 mu g/ml). Future research exploiting real-time salivary bioassays, via fluorescent polarimetry technology, identified by the Office of Naval Research (ONR) as a future Naval requirement, allows researchers to address correlations between stress-induced elaboration of salivary biomarkers with physiological and performance decrements, thereby fostering insight into the underway submariner's psychoimmunological status. This may help identify strategies that enhance resilience to stressors. Specifically, empiricallybased modeling can identify optimal watch-standing schedules and stress-mitigating procedures-within the operational constraints of the submarine milieu and the mission-that foster improved circadian entrainment and reduced stress reactivity, enhancing physiological health, operational performance, safety, and job satisfaction.},

Before PSET, trainees are given detailed, one-on-one instruction on proper ascent mechanics by specially trained Navy Dive instructors. Since the reinstatement of PSET by the U.S. Navy, four incidents of arterial gas embolism (AGE) have occurred in submarine trainees with a 10-year period (2009-2019). Of these four incidents, three were observed within a couple months of each other from 2018 to 2019. A comprehensive review of AGE history, epidemiology, dive physiology, pathophysiology, and management was completed. Prompted by the recent incidents relative to the low reported incidence rate of AGE in historical PSET training, reported potential risk factors were compared with better understand potential etiologies of AGE in already medically screened individuals. Risks and benefits of PSET were listed, compared, and analyzed. The relative safety and cost effectiveness of this rigorous form of training was reconfirmed.},

Approximately 2 to 3 weeks after the accidents, crew members completed the Coping Style Questionnaire, the General Health Questionnaire, the Impact of Event Scale, and the Post-Traumatic Symptom Scale. Although exposed subjects (N = 47) revealed more post-traumatic stress symptoms than nonexposed crew members on shore leave (N = 7), they showed less acute stress reactions than survivors from a surface ship accident in the Norwegian Navy. Inspection of individual cases revealed that 4\% of the exposed submariners showed high loads of acute stress symptoms. Unit cohesion and habitual coping styles emerged as resilience factors, whereas previous exposure to critical incidents and personal experience of not coping in the accident situation emerged as vulnerability factors, explaining 32\% of the acute stress reactions reported by submarine crew members.},

Hanley interrogates and develops modernist concerns established in previous texts such as Stephen Crane's 'The Open Boat' (1897). Hanley's working-class context and his reference to the events of World War II are key to understanding how he differs from Crane. Specifically, Hanley includes an incident where a lifeboat is machine-gunned by a submarine. Some historical context is provided for this incident, and this paper suggests its importance in terms of a modernist preoccupation with meaninglessness. This paper pays special attention to Hanley's use of shifting narrative perspectives in order to examine psychological trauma. In part, this paper argues that Hanley's radical materialism distinguishes him from other modernist writers of the ocean such as Stephen Crane, and, more generally, Joseph Conrad.},

Initial studies for a more serious etiology were negative and he was treated with PO antibiotics for "syphilis" by the local civilian emergency department. After responding well to antibiotics, he subsequently presented back to medical in order to offer up the etiology of his penile wounds. In this report, we review the published literature on penile cellulitis and genital dermatitis artefacta. This case shows that military providers should always have psychiatric causes in their differential and not hesitate to ask about genital abnormalities.

The initial bubble load is thought to emanate from the fast tissues; it is this load that should be lowered to reduce risk of serious neurological DCS. The breathing of oxygen or carbogen (5\% CO2, 95\% O2) post-surfacing was investigated with regard to its ability to reduce the initial bubble load in comparison to air breathing. Thirty-two goats were subject to a dry simulated submarine escape profile to and from 240 meters (2.5 MPa). On surfacing, they breathed air (control), oxygen or carbogen for 30 minutes. Regular Doppler audio bubble grading was carried out, using the Kisman Masurel (KM) scale. One suspected case of DCS was noted. No oxygen toxicity or arterial gas embolism occurred. No significant difference was found between the groups in terms of the median peak KM grade or the period before the KM grade dropped below III. Time to disappearance of bubbles was significantly different between groups; oxygen showed faster bubble resolution than carbogen and air. This reduction in time to bubble resolution may be beneficial in reducing decompression stress, but probably does not affect the risk of fast-tissue DCS.},

  abstract = {The supposed ice melting process leads to a fundamental change in the geopolitical status of the Arctic region: it is becoming more open to different kinds of maritime activities implementation, including navigation, commercial fishing, mineral and energy resources extraction. Not only the Arctic Five (A5) countries, whose coasts are directly washed by the Arctic Ocean, are interested in their realization, but non-regional states also. The 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) gives them such opportunities. According to UNCLOS, the central part of the Arctic Ocean beyond the 200-mile exclusive economic zones (EEZ) of the Arctic countries can be considered as a high seas enclave, with all freedoms of the high seas: of navigation; of overflight; of fishing; of scientific research; freedom to lay submarine cables and pipelines; to construct artificial islands and other installations. The high seas are open to all states, whether coastal or land-locked, which have equal rights here. In addition, it should be noted that other countries have a right to carry out certain practical activities associated with three (out of six) freedoms named above: of navigation (with some restrictions under Article 234 of UNCLOS); of overflight; freedom to lay submarine cables and pipelines - within the Arctic states EEZ. The appearance of new Arctic players interested in its spaces and resources is connected with significant increase in risks and threats, primarily non-military. This is largely due to fundamental differences between the Arctic Ocean and other sea areas, such as the Indian or Atlantic Ocean. Among these differences: only five Arctic states are washed by the Arctic Ocean's waters; shallow depth; small total area; a significant length of the shelf zone; special climate conditions, including ice cap; finally - ecological vulnerability. In this regard, the process of the Arctic region's opening for different kinds of maritime activities implementation poses a problem of the environmental security, protection and preservation of the marine environment and its biological diversity. Despite the fact that security issues in their traditional interpretation are not under the jurisdiction of the Arctic Council, its primary environmental focus indicates that these issues are directly correlated with the main area of its activities. Anyway, the modern interpretation of the "security" concept includes not only a "military", but also an "environmental" component. For the Arctic states, whose geographical position makes them the first victims of any environmental disaster in the region, the provision of environmental security should be the main priority in their mutual policies. The most effective model for the non-military security threats response in the Arctic is cooperation and coordination between all Arctic states at the regional level. One of the problems in the way is that the Arctic Ocean could not be compared with the Baltic and Mediterranean Seas, to which the Article 123 of the UNCLOS "Cooperation of States Bordering Enclosed or Semi-Enclosed Seas" provides the states' right to "coordinate the management, conservation, exploration and exploitation of the living resources of the sea", and to "coordinate the implementation of their rights and duties with respect to the protection and preservation of the marine environment". However, the recent transformation of the international maritime law gives Arctic countries some opportunities in this area. First, the regime of the high seas is becoming less conducive for implementation of specific types of maritime activities. In the future, we can expect that the extent of regulation in this area of the World ocean will be significantly increased. The implementation of the high seas freedoms is largely conditioned by the realization of the tasks to protect and preserve the marine environment and its biodiversity. Second, there is a continuing practice of expanding the authority of coastal states in their jurisdiction zones, especially in the EEZ. Despite the fact that the coastal state is not granted any competence in the field of the EEZ security, the practice of a broad interpretation of the "security" concept includes food, resource and environment security. The enforcement of such security regimes is becoming an increasingly common practice, even though it imposes certain restrictions for third countries' rights in these sea areas. Finally, the adoption of security measures in the EEZ, on one hand, and at the high sea, on the other, should be recognized interdependent and considered all together. In the near future, the number of potential security threats can be significantly expanded due to the increase in the number of maritime activities participants. In addition to the already existing non-military threats (pollution of the marine environment; illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing), new threats may appear: armed robbery of ships (piracy); acts of terrorism affecting both the shipping and offshore installations (oil and gas platforms); illegal transportation of weapons, including weapons of mass destruction (WMD); illegal transportation of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances; illegal movement of people by sea, including illegal migration. An effective response to these types of threats requires not only individual efforts of the Arctic Five countries, but also collective security measures. In this regard, in order to create a regional security model, the development of collaboration and cooperation between the Arctic countries is essential.},

In certain special conditions, e.g., on submarines and commercial ships, non-24-h watch schedules are often employed, which have also been demonstrated to be deleterious to circadian rhythms. Personnel working under such conditions suffer from circadian misalignment with their on-watch hours, leading to increased health risks and decreased cognitive performance. In this review, we summarize the research progress and knowledge concerning circadian rhythms on submarines and other environments in which non-24-h watch schedules are employed.},

Rather, the Navy viewed systems as combinations of hardware and software. The results were often less-than-optimal capability and high life-cycle costand, sometimes, even mission failure. Given the high rate of technological change and the need to rein in cost in the face of increasingly constrained budgets, the Navy and the other services have increasingly embraced the need to consider human-performance capabilities and limitations up front and on an equal footing with hardware and softwareas integral elements in both new-acquisition and technology-refresh programs. The US Submarine Force has championed human systems integration (HSI). HSI is a specialized engineering discipline that takes human limitations and capabilities fully into account to influence system design and engineering early in the research, development, and acquisition process, thereby helping to ensure the highest overall performance at the lowest total ownership cost. Implementation of HSI has involved new partnerships with unlikely partners such as the audio equipment company Bose, game-makers, the visual-reality industry, physiologists, and psychologists. Nowhere has this been more apparent than in the Virginia (SSN-774)-Class Nuclear Attack Submarine Program.},

  abstract = {Introduction To assess the self-perceived mental health of soldiers and officers in the submarine force in the South China Sea, the result of this investigation was compared to the Chinese military male norms, and the factors that influence their mental health was further explored. Materials and Methods A total of 580 male submariners agreed to participate. In the final analysis, 511 valid questionnaires were included; 69 incomplete questionnaires were excluded. The Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90) was used to measure the self-perceived mental health of the officers and soldiers. Results The scores of four dimensions (somatization, anxiety, phobic anxiety, and paranoid ideation) and the average of the total SCL-90 scores for the submarine force in the South China Sea were significantly higher than the Chinese military norms. Age and length of service were found to be protective factors, with 26- to 30-year-old age group (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.365, 95\% CI = 0.138-0.961) and individuals with 6 to 10 years of service (AOR = 0.357, 95\% CI = 0.151-0.842) having lower odds of poor mental health. Education level (bachelor's degree) and workplace (nuclear submarine) were found to be risk factors. Conclusions This study demonstrates for the first time that soldiers and officers in the submarine force in the South China Sea are exposed to a number of mental health risks and are suffering from serious psychological problems. These findings provide a basis for military departments to effectively address these psychological problems.},

Throughout modern Korean history, an idealized image of America has played the role of Korea's ego-ideal. While the U.S. has provided South Korea with its form of government and the foundation of a capitalist economy, it has also defined the trajectory of many aspects of modern Korean history since Liberation in 1945. Furthermore, a series of historical experiences have caused significant changes in America's image. Today, the U.S. appears even as the obscene superego, the other side of the Other. These aspects of America correspond to the three father figures presented by Lacan: the idealized imaginary father, the symbolic father, and the obscene and violent real father. Shifting views of America as the Other have been reflected in Korean films. In Spring in My Hometown and Phantom: The Submarine, the oppressive aspect of the American Other takes the figure of the obscene real father. In Joint Security Area, the split between the American Other and the Other of a unified Korean national community is far more manifest. Today, Korean subjects are still not free from the gaze of the American Other and the determining power of the U.S.},

  abstract = {The Royal Navy requires reliable advice on the safe limits of escape from a distressed submarine (DISSUB). Flooding in a DISSUB may cause a rise in ambient pressure, increasing the risk of decompression sickness (DCS) and decreasing the maximum depth from which it is safe to escape. The aim of this study was to investigate the pressure/depth limits to escape following saturation at raised ambient pressure. Exposure to saturation pressures up to 1.6 bar (a) (160 kPa) (n = 38); escapes from depths down to 120 meters of sea water (msw) (n = 254) and a combination of saturation followed by escape (n = 90) was carried out in the QinetiQ Submarine Escape Simulator, Alverstoke, United Kingdom. Doppler ultrasound monitoring was used to judge the severity of decompression stress. The trials confirmed the previously untested advice, in the Guardbook, that if a DISSUB was lying at a depth of 90 msw, then it was safe to escape when the pressure in the DISSUB was 1.5 bar (a), but also indicated that this advice may be overly conservative. This study demonstrated that the upper DISSUB saturation pressure limit to safe escape from 90 msw was 1.6 bar (a), resulting in two cases of DCS.

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: There is a widespread and long-held belief in the submarine community that submariners father more daughters than the general population. The U.S. Sex Ratio at birth (males/females) has remained around 1.05 since the early 2000s. Limited evidence exists that certain environmental exposures including chemicals, heavy metals, radiation and g-forces may influence sex ratio at birth. A reduction in male births in a population has been associated with lower male fertility. A 1970 single site study showed a higher ratio of female offspring in personnel serving aboard U.S. Navy nuclear submarines than the general population. A 2004 study concluded that this was probably not true. However, this study was small, and did not evaluate the difference between children conceived during sea duty versus shore duty. They did note a higher chance of female offspring correlated with a longer time in the community, as well as an increased ratio in sonar technicians. These findings warrant further investigation. METHODS: An electronic survey was e-mailed to submariners, after receiving required IRB and Navy approvals. Participants were asked birth year, year they entered submarine service, and how many children they had. For each child they were asked sex, child's birth year, mother's birth year, and whether they were on sea duty or shore duty at the time of conception. Those who were on sea duty at the time of conception were asked what their job was, where they were stationed and what type of submarine they were on. Those who were on shore duty at the time of conception were asked whether they were in contact with submarines on a regular basis, whether they were officer or enlisted, and what region they were stationed in for shore duty. RESULTS: Four thousand eight hundred responses were received with a total of 6,958 children included in the analysis. Respondents had a SR of 0.95 compared to 1.05 U.S. population in 2015 (p {$<$} 0.0001). Submariners on sea duty had a SR of 0.88 compared to 1.02 on shore duty (p = 0.007). Those who had regular submarine contact on shore duty had a SR of 0.72 compared to 1.17 in those who did not (p {$<$} 0.001). Geographical location during shore duty did show differences that were statistically significant (p = 0.018). Geographical location during sea duty did not show significant differences. No significant differences were seen for paternal age, maternal age, job during sea duty, type of submarine assigned to or time in community. CONCLUSION: The submariners surveyed reported greater numbers of daughters than the general population, especially when on sea duty or in regular contact with submarines during shore duty. Further study should be done to confirm results and explore possible etiologies of differences in sex ratio.},

The main factors in an abnormal environment are: psychological (isolation, sensory deprivation, sensory overload, sleep deprivation, temporal disorientation); psychophysiological (thermal, stress positions), and psychosocial (cultural humiliation, sexual degradation). Each single factor may not be considered tortuous, however, if deliberately structured into a systemic cluster may constitute torture under legal definition.

Taking their inspiration from the song 'Yellow Submarine' (Revolver, 1966), the filmmakers created a narrative for a psychedelic 'hero's journey' from existing Beatles songs. This article discusses how the musical codes that symbolise different groups are used to mediate between divergent elements in both the film and contemporary society, by referring to such elements beyond the film as the Beatles' comprehensive body of songs (which in itself forms a kind of mythology) and cultural events of the time. In Yellow Submarine, the Blue Meanies imprison Pepperland by immobilising all producers of music, whether 'classical' (the string quartet led by the elderly Lord Mayor) or 'vernacular' (Sgt.

Although the UK is located away from subduction zones (the most common origin of tsunamis), tsunamis have struck its shores, most notably those triggered by the prehistoric Storegga submarine landslide and the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. Since the major events of 2004 (Indian Ocean) and 2011 (Japan) tsunamis are in the public psyche, even if the risks to UK coasts are not. Due to this heightened awareness, many reported events are claimed to be tsunamis and the potential for tsunamis is increasingly included in risk planning; understanding the true frequency of tsunamis is therefore important. Within the UK, the evidence for tsunamis includes tide gauge readings, reported visual observations and interpretation of sedimentological features. Catalogues need to consider whether the event is a true tsunami in order to avoid a plethora of claims that confound risk assessments; for example, recent well-documented events generated by weather systems (meteotsunamis) provide a possible explanation for some historical events. A detailed examination of the impact of tsunamis upon the UK coast is provided, including examples of events triggered by the three primary causes of tsunamis: seismicity, submarine landslides and coastal landslides.},

  abstract = {Introduction Maintaining healthy, well-trained, and highly qualified armed forces is critical for ensuring military readiness. The purpose of this article is to contribute to the body of research focused on the health of U.S. Navy submariners and to identify the health conditions of U.S. Navy submariners during their final year of active duty service. Materials and Methods In this retrospective cohort study, we examined medical records and personnel files of separating U.S. Navy sailors who were: (1) active duty between 2009 and 2018; (2) separated before 2019; and (3) were assigned to a submarine for at least 30 days. Both officers and enlisted service members were included. We linked, described, and analyzed data from the Defense Health Agency, Military Health System Data Repository (MDR), and the Bureau of Naval Personnel (BUPERS). International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnoses codes were obtained from MDR. Data collected from BUPERS include age, sex, and rank. We determined the number of individuals who had at least one diagnosed condition (identified as a three-digit ICD code). We report the number of diagnoses and calculate prevalence rates and confidence intervals per condition, as well as prevalence rates per year, using standard formulas. The study was approved by the Naval Submarine Medical Research Laboratory Institutional Review Board. Results During the study period, 26,014 submariners separated from the Navy. The average number of separations per year was 2,601. About a third of the separating submariners were in the 25 to 29 age group and over 50\% were under 30 years of age. Of the three-digit individual ICD codes, some of the highest operationally relevant rates over the 10-year study period (2009-2018) were for joint disorders (prevalence rate [PR] = 180 per 1,000 submariners), back disorders (PR = 128), and sleep disorders (PR = 134). Three mental-health-related conditions were also among the 20 conditions with the highest rates. Conclusions High rates of specific diagnoses such as joint disorders indicate the need for additional study to examine causal relationships, to determine which conditions may contribute to lost work time, early separations, or low rates of reenlistment and which conditions might be a result of specific military occupations or duties. Study strengths are the large number of subjects and the long period of observations. A study weakness was the inability to identify submariners who separated because of health conditions. The overall impact of the study is that it identifies urgent health risks and establishes a way to prioritize future research. Future research should include a focus on medically separated personnel; compare rates for submariners to other military groups including all-Navy and all-Department of Defense; and determine specific and relative risks as a necessary precursor to developing, implementing, and testing risk reduction and health improvement interventions.},

  abstract = {Heavy metals (HMs) enter the marine environment through a variety of sources, especially in areas such as submarine canyons acting as conduits for terrigenous pollutants to the deep sea. HMs exert toxic effects at different levels of biological organization, yet several marine microbes have the capacity to tolerate HMs. However, the relationships between microbes, their tolerance mechanisms and the concentration of HMs in the marine environment are poorly investigated. We evaluated the occurrence and distribution of HMs and culturable HM-resistant microorganisms in sediments collected in two submarine canyons and the adjacent slope in the NE Ligurian margin (Mediterranean Sea), down to 2000 m depth, and explored the role of contaminants in modulating community adaptation to metals. HM concentrations exhibited wide spatial variability across the whole study area, without showing significant differences between canyon and open slope environments, exception made for higher Cd concentrations recorded in one canyon. Benthic microbial abundance was negatively correlated with Cd concentration, while viable counts of HM-resistant microorganisms indicated tolerance of HMs in the order Zn2+ {$>$} Cu2+ {$>$} He2+ {$>$} Cd2+. Differences in the tolerance patterns were observed among sampling stations, with microbial communities generally tolerating up to three HMs. Cd2+ was the less tolerated metal, with microbial growth in the presence of this metal observed only for 50 ppm, and only at five of the eleven sampled stations. Our results show the existence of complex multitolerance patterns in deepsea sediments subjected to anthropogenic influence, suggesting that microbial HM tolerance develops under different ways and mechanisms that have to be elicited. Also, they highlight the opportunity for further exploitation of the potential of HM-resistant deep sea microbes for the remediation of contaminated marine areas, or for their use as bioindicators of human impact down to the deep sea.},

  abstract = {Introduction: A nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine (SSBN) is a singular professional environment, exposing personnel to isolation and confinement amidst sophisticated technology for the duration of a mission. Submariners see their mood and cognition deteriorate as their mission progresses. With regard to the benefits of physical activity (PA) on mental health, this study evaluates the impact of regular PA on the maintenance of thymia and sensory functioning during patrols. Method: This pragmatic exploratory cohort follow-up study included 29 volunteer submariners before, during and 1 month after return from patrol. PA practice was evaluated by a daily self-questionnaire. This allowed submariners to be classified into two groups according to the median of the total duration in minutes of a sport practiced during the patrol (PA practicing submariners and non-practicing). Changes in mood and psychological activation, health (including sleep), unipodal stability, and accommodation distances were compared between the two groups over the period of the patrol. Results: Overall thymic functioning deteriorated during the patrol. Submariners who practice PA maintain a stable level of activation unlike non-practicing PA submariners, but they exhibited both worse general health and sleep at recovery. For these personnel, postural control is better at the end of the patrol and far visual accommodation tends to be preserved. Conclusion: PA during patrol alone is not sufficient to compensate for the thymic dysregulation induced by the SSBN environment. Nevertheless, it seems to help in maintaining an exteroceptive functioning. This exploratory study suggests directions for possible future research on physical activity associated with sensory stimulation amongst submariners, and more generally amongst people working in isolated and confined environments.},

Nevertheless, the scale of confinement implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented. In addition to reviewing the published studies, we need to anticipate the psychological problems that could arise during or at a distance from confinement. We have gone beyond the COVID-19 literature in order to examine the implications of the known consequences of confinement, like boredom, social isolation, stress, or sleep deprivation. Anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, suicidal or addictive behaviours, domestic violence are described effects of confinement, but the mechanisms of emergence of these disorders and their interrelationships remain to be studied. For example, what are the mechanisms of emergence of post-traumatic stress disorders in the context of confinement? We also remind the reader of points of vigilance to be kept in mind with regard to eating disorders and hallucinations. Hallucinations are curiously ignored in the literature on confinement, whereas a vast literature links social isolation and hallucinations. Due to the broad psychopathological consequences, we have to look for these various symptoms to manage them. We quickly summarize the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches already in place, such as telemedicine, which is undergoing rapid development during the COVID-19 crisis. (C) 2020 L'Encephale, Paris.},

During the research, the physiological indexes of the volunteers were first measured both before and after the experiment for which the coal mine accidents are simulated; next, the extent of the variations and the significant differences of the indexes are analyzed. The results indicate that the victims of the accident have experienced intense physiological and psychological changes. These significant physiological and psychological changes include: systolic blood pressure, mean pressure, pulse rate, pulse pressure, heart rate, R-R interval, R wave amplitude respiratory rate. The one that has gone through the most significant variation is the pulse pressure. However, only the systolic blood pressure and the heart rate have demonstrated significant change during the second trial. Practical Applications: The psychological changes of the victims are rather rapid and complex. The victims' abilities for carrying out proper judgments and actions that accord with the surrounding were weakened by their physiological state. It is of significance to quantitatively analyze physiological variation of the victims, to select the staffs through the personality assessment and to improve individual's psychological quality and the ability of emergency disposal by training in the simulated accident scenarios.

Mission averages reflected suboptimal sleep that was of short overall duration (5:46 +/- 1:29 h per 24-h day) and relatively low efficiency (82.5 +/- 9.9\%); suboptimal levels of cognitive performance (PVT mRT = 283 +/- 35 ms; PVT response errors = 5.3 +/- 4.8); and moderate levels of self-reported recovery. Whilst self-reported recovery status remained stable across mission days, small but consistent day-to-day increases in sleep onset latency and PVT mRT accumulated to reflect meaningful deterioration in sleep and cognitive performance across the entire 67-day mission (i.e., 47\% and 16\% of the overall mission average, respectively). Future work is required to corroborate the current findings, firmly establish underlying causes, and make evidence-based suggestions for interventions to improve and uphold submariners' health and performance.},

  abstract = {British diving science is reviewed from its beginnings around the turn of the century until free diving became common practise in the early 1970s.  Most attention is focussed on the pioneering years. Two types of scientists are considered:  those who studied diving science itself, especially diver physiology, and those who pursued their science by diving.  Pre-eminent among the former were the Haldanes.  By 1907 John Scott Haldane had produced the first decompression tables.  Thirty-two years later his son, J. B. S. Haldane, began to investigate the fate of men trapped in disabled submarines.  His father had wisely studied the physiology of working Navy divers, but the son studied the effects on himself and his colleagues of breathing a deteriorating atmosphere in pressurized chambers.  Few experimenters in any field have required more courage.  Haldane's team mounted the first systematic study of nitrogen narcosis and set safe lower limits for divers breathing compressed air or oxygen.  J. B. S. Haldane was also the first to describe the potential of using helium-oxygen mixtures for deep diving. The early achievements of the Royal Navy's Experimental Diving Unit and, later, its Physiological Laboratory were also substantial.  They not only produced improved decompression tables, but also pioneered the use of helium mixtures for deep diving and the physiological consequences of doing so. The British pioneers among those who merely used diving as a means to gain access to the subtidal region were biologists.  F. S. Russell and A. P. Orr used a bucket-sized diving bell helmet during the Great Barrier Reef expedition in 1928.  Jack Kitching used a similar device to conduct the first underwater diving surveys in British waters from 1931 to 1936.  He penetrated to 12 m and produced results of real scientific merit. The invention of the aqualung brought diving within the reach of many more scientists.  In Britain the first use of SCUBA for scientific research was Bainbridge's study of swimming zooplankton published in 1952.  Forster's surveys of the underwater life around Devon were first published in 1954 and two years later Joanna Kain began her classic studies of Laminaria off the Isle of Man.  Brief reviews are presented of the achievements in the other main fields of underwater endeavour, including diver psychology, underwater archaeology and geomorphology. Of necessity, these pioneers often dived alone, but soon there were courses for diving scientists and small groups of research divers were forming in the Isle of Man, Plymouth, Durham, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Cambridge and elsewhere.  A joint expedition to Malta in 1965 laid the foundations for the Underwater Association for Scientific Research which subsequently acted as a conduit for the organization and publication of much British diving science.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this article is a historical and anthropological examination of the phenomenon of fear, the methods of its manifestation and overcoming in the shadow of war. The authors refer to battlefield and postwar diaries from 1943-1946 of G. I. Sennikov, a submarine sailor of the Northern Fleet, marine electrician of "M-107" and "M-119". The authors use methods of historiographical and mythopoetic analysis, and the biographic method. In Sennikov's battlefield diary, the authors observe the sailor's analytical approach to the problem of fear: his story is not just a documentation and detailed description of the physical signs of horror, but also a classification of the types of fear, exploration of different aspects of a person's fear at war, and an attempt to get an insight into the essence of this phenomenon. The research reveals that the young sailor perceived the war as a death-defying admission and initiation at the ultimate threshold and is described with the help of archetypical figures: a monster ship, a coffin boat, the sea, etc. The young man who found himself in the extremely harsh wartime conditions identifies such characteristic features of a submarine sailor's psychology as sailor fatalism, a certain superstitious religiousness (belief in signs, dreams, "marked" spaces and taboos, amulets, and taboo systems). In his diaries, G. I. Sennikov does not only identify superstitious religiousness and ritual activities as the most efficient weapon against fear, but also creativity, laughter, games, and, most significantly, personal values, the authority of commanding officers, and conviction that Soviet submarine sailors fight for the right cause, on the side of the good, saving the world from the horrors of fascism.},

The author considers experience of the battle conditions, which requires an innovative approach to functions and intensity of physical exercises and physical load during the duty in a self-contained trip. The research has shown that physical load should in the first instance compensate a lack of motion activity, working capability support, active recreation and emotional harmonizing of psychophysical state, instead of fulfilling the training aims. If the exercises are possible under conditions of a campaign, it is reasonable to organize complex aerobic training with the load of 35-50\% from maximal load with implementation of heterogenous exercises of coordinating kind. For example, variative physical actions of a catch-style wrestling match of three-minute duration with simplified rules (during a campaign the exercise was limited and was substituted by imitation is a match by analogy with "shadow-fighting". The author have conducted a prolonged exploration of correlation between the type of physical exercises used by servicemen and average consecutive days of temporary incapacity for work of them in the course of an annual cycle of military service during the period after ending of a campaign. The experimental and the control groups, formed from teams of nuclear-powered submarines of "Borei" type, have shown the evident difference: the experimental groups gained the better results as compared to the groups who weren't undergoing the updated program. The results of the forming pedagogic experiment have reflected the effectiveness of the newly developed innovative program of physical training of a submarine's team.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Psychological fitness is an important component to operational unit readiness and success. Embedding behavioral health providers can reduce unplanned personnel losses (UPL) as a result of psychological stress. The U.S. Submarine Forces implemented the Submarine Squadron 6 (CSS-6) Embedded Mental Health Pilot (EMHP) Program to address this type of UPL, which is classified as a Code 2 loss. The aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the EMHP Program at reducing UPL by improving psychological readiness through expedited access to care. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using data from the CSS-6 EMHP Program, we identified the cohort of patients who were evaluated and received a full course of treatment from August 1, 2013, to April 30, 2015, and examined their final dispositions. A comparative review of Code 2 losses between 2012 and 2014 was performed to assess for any reduction in the annual incidence of Code 2 losses with EMHP. The Outcome Questionnaire (OQ-45) survey was used to determine the quantitative impact of EMHP on patient psychological readiness. We performed multiple regression analysis to identify any significant correlation between all independent variables and improvement in final OQ-45 scores. We performed logistic regression analysis to assess the logistic score as a function of predicting patient probability of returning vice not returning to duty. The logistic score is a by-product of the end results data and was not an original metric when the program was started. The Clinical Investigations Department at Naval Medical Center, Portsmouth waived this study from institutional review board review. Authorization was obtained from the U.S. Submarine Forces Command Public Affairs Office to publish the contents of this study. RESULTS: EMHP providers conducted a total of 878 patient sessions for 183 sailors over a 21-month period. There were eight fewer Code 2 losses after 2014, the first full calendar year with EMHP. This decrease in the number of Code 2 losses was in fact statistically significant, given p {$<$} 0.001. EMHP providers saw a 200\% increase in patient volume and contributed to a 12\% decrease in the annual incidence of Code 2 losses in 2014. Seventy patients returning to duty demonstrated clinically and statistically significant improvements in OQ-45 scores at the end of treatment. Only the initial symptomatic distress score on the OQ-45 survey demonstrated any statistical significance of predicting an improvement in OQ-45 composite scores by the end of treatment, given p {$<$} 0.01. A negative logistic score was significantly associated with not returning to duty (odds ratio, 16.0; 95\% confidence interval, 5.22-49.02; χ2 = 30.63; p {$<$} 0.001). CONCLUSION: The EMHP Program reduced Code 2 losses and positively promoted psychological hygiene for submariners. With the establishment of embedded programs at other squadrons, we can develop a longitudinal study that provides a more inclusive assessment of this model. A future study may be warranted to evaluate the validity of the logistic score as a metric to determine further fitness for submarine duty.},

Hypercortisolism is a state of chronically elevated cortisol levels due to a failure to return to, or maintain baseline levels. It is a condition that is often undiagnosed and can aid in the development of many physiological and psychological health problems. Some of the health ailments associated with hypercortisolism include metabolic syndrome, decreases in bone mineral density, and depression. Chronic stress and sleep deprivation are two common causes of hypercortisolism, both areas of concern within the submarine community. This review discusses the etiology of hypercortisolism and the likelihood of submariner vulnerability to the condition along with health problems associated with it. Lastly, strategies to prevent chronic elevation of cortisol and mitigate the potential health risks associated with the condition are covered.

  abstract = {Background: Survival time within a disabled submarine (SUBSUNK) is dependant on atmospheric composition and proper design and use of emergency atmospheric control systems. The objective of this study was to investigate atmospheric changes and physiological responses during a SUBSUNK trial. Methods: There were 18 volunteers who were restrained within a 250 m3 front compartment of an Ula-class submarine submerged in 8°C seawater for 6 d, 18 h. Atmospheric control was maintained according to emergency procedures using non-electrically powered chemical CO2 absorption, and O2 was replenished using chlorate candles. Atmospheric parameters, skin and body temperatures, weight, urine, and drinking volume were measured. Subjective responses to cold were measured on a visual analog scale (VAS), and symptoms were logged on the environmental symptoms questionnaire (ESQ). Results: Atmospheric temperature gradually decreased to a minimum of 14.1°C. Toe, heel, and finger temperatures decreased significantly. Subjects reported inferior subjective thermal comfort on the VAS and increased cold stress on the ESQ. Except for CO2, no inorganic or volatile organic compounds exceeded occupational exposure limits. The PO2 and PCO2 ranged from 17.4-20.3 and 1.9-2.8 kPa, respectively, during the first 5 d. During the last 2 d, PO2 and PCO2 were deliberately maintained at about 15.8 and 3.1 kPa, respectively. Mean oxygen consumption and CO2 production were 23,8 and 19.8 L standard temperature and pressure (STP) · man-1 · h-1, respectively. Soda lime and lithium hydroxide CO2 absorption capacities were 126 and 405 L STP · kg-1 respectively. Conclusions: Atmospheric conditions can be controlled acceptably for 6d, 18 h within the front compartment of an Ula-class submarine operating according to emergency SUBSUNK procedures.},

  abstract = {The command room system has developed across a century of submarine operations and so reflects a high state of evolution, but that does not mean that the system cannot be improved upon. Technological advances have resulted in the retrospective fitting of upgrades which may not have maximized the potential improvements offered. Future challenges for command teams in almost every domain include increasing amounts of data coupled with more automated systems and reduced manning. To optimise functionality new physical layouts, team structures, allocation of system functions, communication media, interfaces, and work design will be required. The aim of the ComTET (Command Team Experimental Test-Bed) project is to examine how a submarine command team currently functions, with specific regard to how information flows around the socio-technical system. This information shall be used to evaluate limitations in the current system, promote ideas concerning where reduced crewing might be possible and highlight how extra data might best be integrated into the system. Phase 1 of ComTET involved the creation of a submarine command room with high physical and task fidelity. The ComTET team has designed and built a submarine command room simulator that is a representation of the currently operational ASTUTE submarine. The simulator is comprised of 10 workstations each with two stacked monitors, various input devices and a headset linked to a multi-channel communications network. The simulation engine is a custom build of Dangerous Waters software, a naval warfare simulation game. The software features many operator-controllable units from on board a submarine, allowing the completion of individual submariner command team tasks simultaneously to fulfil global (team) mission objectives. The ComTET laboratory has a range of devices for recording the personal communications of each operator, in addition to video recordings of each operator and ambient voice/video recordings. This will facilitate the construction of social, task and information networks to examine the command room from a socio-technical perspective. The laboratory is also equipped with physiological recording devices so that the workload of operatives can be examined using psycho-physiological approaches alongside commonly used standardised measures of workload, situation awareness and cognitive function. The data collected shall be based around three scenarios which capture the primary operations routinely completed by submariners in high and low work load conditions. (C) 2015 The Authors.

A submarine control room simulator was built, using a non-commercial version of Dangerous Waters as the simulation engine. The creation of networked workstations allowed a team of nine operators to perform tasks completed by submarine command teams during DT. The Event Analysis of Systemic Teamwork (EAST) method was used to model the social, task and information networks and describe command team performance. Ten teams were recruited for the study, affording statistical comparisons of how command team roles and level of demand affected performance. Results indicate that command teams can covertly DT a contact differently depending on demand (e.g. volume of contacts). In low demand it was possible to use periscope more often than in high demand, in a 'duck-and-run' fashion. Therefore, the type of information and frequency of particular task completion, was significantly different between the higher and lower demand conditions. This resulted in different operators in the command team experiencing greater demand depending on how the DT mission objective was completed. Potential bottlenecks in the command team were identified and implications are discussed alongside suggestions for future work.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Submarines routinely operate with higher levels of ambient carbon dioxide (CO2) (i.e., 2000 - 5000 ppm) than what is typically considered normal (i.e., 400 - 600 ppm). Although significant cognitive impairments are rarely reported at these elevated CO2 levels, recent studies using the Strategic Management Simulation (SMS) test have found impairments in decision-making performance during acute CO2 exposure at levels as low as 1000 ppm. This is a potential concern for submarine operations, as personnel regularly make mission-critical decisions that affect the safety and efficiency of the vessel and its crew while exposed to similar levels of CO2. The objective of this study was to determine if submariner decision-making performance is impacted by acute exposure to levels of CO2 routinely present in the submarine atmosphere during sea patrols. METHODS: Using a subject-blinded balanced design, 36 submarine-qualified sailors were randomly assigned to receive 1 of 3 CO2 exposure conditions (600, 2500, or 15,000 ppm). After a 45-min atmospheric acclimation period, participants completed an 80-min computer-administered SMS test as a measure of decision making. RESULTS: There were no significant differences for any of the nine SMS measures of decision making between the CO2 exposure conditions. DISCUSSION: In contrast to recent research demonstrating cognitive deficits on the SMS test in students and professional-grade office workers, we were unable to replicate this effect in a submariner population-even with acute CO2 exposures more than an order of magnitude greater than those used in previous studies that demonstrated such effects.Rodeheffer CD, Chabal S, Clarke JM, Fothergill DM.

Problem-directed strategies and interpersonal sensitivity combined with strong achievement motivation were related to low indicated stress from social factors (lack of privacy, interpersonal tension, and crowding) and homesickness.

In addition to these terrestrial and coastal temperate habitats, similar strains were also found to colonize deep-sea ecosystems and were isolated mainly from gorgonian and solitary corals and other invertebrates (Phylum Cnidaria, Annelida, Echinodermata, Arthropoda, and Porifera) living up to 4700-m depth and at a temperature of 2-4 A degrees C in the submarine Avil,s Canyon. Similar strains have been also repeatedly isolated from atmospheric precipitations (rain drops, snow, and hailstone) collected in the same area throughout a year observation time. These ubiquitous strains were found to be halotolerant, psychrotolerant, and barotolerant. Bioactive compounds with diverse antibiotic and cytotoxic activities produced by these strains were identified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and database comparison. These include antibacterials (paulomycins A and B), antifungals (maltophilins), antifungals displaying also cytotoxic activities (antimycins and 6-epialteramides), and the antitumor compound fredericamycin.

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: It is estimated that sailors who are assigned to surface ships and submarines are deployed for more than 1 year across their careers and they spend 15\% to 23\% of their time away from home. Research suggests that shipboard sailors experience rates of behavioral health issues similar to those with ground combat experiences. Despite the rigorous operational tempo and the unique shipboard environment experienced by these service members, little military health research has examined the health outcomes of sailors serving aboard ships. The objectives of this study were to develop an evidence map of the peer-reviewed literature to (1) identify potential threats to the health and readiness of shipboard sailors, (2) identify health and performance issues experienced by this population, and (3) identify gaps in the current peer-reviewed published literature on shipboard health and performance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review of the existing peer-reviewed literature pertaining to the health, experiences, and performance of shipboard service members was conducted. Comprehensive search terms were used to identify articles published between January 2000 and April 2018. Identified articles were subject to a two-level review process. Study characteristics for all articles selected for final review were extracted, and articles were categorized into 13 content areas that were selected a priori. Findings are presented in an evidence map. RESULTS: The initial literature search yielded 8,858 unique articles, 90 of which were eligible for full review. Most articles primarily examined active duty sailors from the U.S. or other foreign militaries (88.9\%). A total of 60 articles (67.8\%) included information about the type of ship studied; the most frequently examined were submarines (29.5\%) and aircraft carriers (27.9\%). Most of the included studies used cross-sectional (63.3\%) or longitudinal (24.4\%) designs. Only 7.8\% (n\,=\,7) of articles described interventions. The most commonly examined focal areas included physical health issues, such as viral infections and injuries (56.7\%), and health behaviors, such as substance use/misuse (40.0\%). Other frequently addressed content areas were occupational stress (38.9\%), interpersonal issues (32.2\%), ship conditions (30.0\%), and mental health (28.9\%). Most articles (73.3\%) addressed more than one content area. There was a high degree of variation in the measurement tools used; self-report surveys were the most common (48.9\%), followed by objective physical, biological, or cognitive measures (32.2\%) and medical and personnel record reviews (31.1\%). CONCLUSIONS: The evidence map identified various gaps in the research pertaining to the health and performance of shipboard sailors. These gaps included a lack of research on the risk factors for common health and performance issues experienced by sailors and on the relationship between stressors of shipboard life and sailors' health, performance, and readiness. The results of this evidence map should be used to inform the development, implementation, and evaluation of interventions to improve the shipboard environment and/or the preventive health behaviors used by sailors while underway or deployed.},

This situation may result from stressors encountered during the flight (microgravity, radiation, psychological stress, or confinement) or from physiological changes (demineralization or fluid shift). Therefore, ground-based investigations should be designed to determine the effects of these factors on the immune system. Very little is known about the influence of confinement or isolation on immune reactions. However, interesting data exist from experiments with animals and humans under different conditions (submarines, antarctic expeditions, single-person cave isolation, and underwater diving). The question remains as to whether these results can be extrapolated to spaceflight. Therefore, investigations of humans under isolation conditions analogous to space missions have been performed by Russian and, more recently, European investigators. Such investigations are important for understanding the physiological and psychological disturbances that occur during long periods of confinement, especially when future lunar and martian missions are considered.},

We reported previously that a 10-d confinement caused changes in immune status. Here we report the relationship between mood changes and immune parameters in the subjects confined for 10-d. Methods: There were 10 subjects (age 20-27 yr, mean 22.8 yr) who participated in a 10-d confinement study. They were divided into 2 groups with regard to their psychological aspects and their immune parameters were then compared. Blood samples were taken once before, three times during, and once after confinement. The percentages of granulocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, and cells positive for CD69, an early activation marker, were analyzed by flow cytometry. Face scale was employed to estimate subjects' mood. Results: The group that showed an increase in mood scale toward the end of the confinement showed changes in all immune parameters. In contrast, less marked changes were seen in the group that showed no mood changes throughout the experiment. Discussion: These results indicate that the observed immune changes were related to the mood changes, and that mood change seems to be one of the causes of the immunological changes seen in confined environments, such as in space stations or submarines. The percentages of NK cells, granulocytes, and CD69 expression may be useful criteria for detecting immunological deterioration caused by stress, or for selecting astronauts who are immunologically stable against the challenge of confinement stress.},

  abstract = {High-demand jobs include 'specific' job demands that are not preventable with state of the art ergonomics knowledge and may overburden the bodily capacities, safety or health of workers. An interesting question is whether the age of the worker is an important factor in explanations of diversity in work ability in the context of high-demand jobs. In this paper, the work ability of ageing workers is addressed according to aspects of diversity in specific job demands and the research methods that are needed to shed light upon the relevant associated questions. From the international literature, a body of evidence was elicited concerning rates of chronological ageing in distinct bodily systems and functions. Intra-age-cohort differences in capacities and work ability, however, require (not yet existing) valid estimates of functional age or biological age indices for the specific populations of workers in high-demand jobs. Many studies have drawn on the highly demanding work of fire-fighters, ambulance workers, police officers, medical specialists, pilots/astronauts and submarine officers. Specific job demands in these jobs can be physical, mental or psychosocial in origin but may cause combined task-level loadings. Therefore, the assessment of single demands probably will not reveal enough relevant information about work ability in high-demand jobs and there will be a call for more integrated measures. Existing studies have used a variety of methodologies to address parts of the issue: task analyses for quantifying physical work demands, observations of psychological and physiological parameters, measures of psychosocial work demands and health complaints. Specific details about the work ability of ageing workers in high-demand jobs are scarce. In general, specific demands are more likely to overtax the capacities of older workers than those of younger workers in high-demand jobs, implying greater repercussions for health, although these effects also vary considerably within age cohorts. Functional tests for job-specific work ability should be developed for high-demand jobs in order to monitor individual functional ageing and to facilitate well-timed intervention. It is concluded that a shift from 'no-diversity thinking' to 'diversity thinking' is needed in the context of deciding about the work ability of ageing workers in high-demand jobs.

Case histories provide a wealth of detail, but few investigators understand the challenges of properly applying this method. This study reviews some of the strengths and weaknesses of the actuarial and case history methods, and presents a four celled taxonomy of stress based on method (actuarial and case history) and effects (distress and eustress).

Based largely on the reminiscences of submarine veterans, this article argues that men's attitudes also played a significant role in coping with danger on patrols. Many submariners adopted a fatalistic attitude that allowed them to accept or deny the likelihood of their deaths.

Restraint, hyperbaric air and immersion were chosen to produce the simulation stress model in rats for four hours. Rats were randomized into five groups: control group, restraint (R) group, hyperbaric air (H) group, restraint plus hyperbaric air (RH) group, and restraint plus hyperbaric air plus immersion (RHI) group. The results showed that the responses to the simulation stress model of the undersea environment induced by R, H, RH and RHI involved the upregulated norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DA) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) of the central nervous system (CNS), upregulated adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), corticosterone (CORT) and blood glucose of the neuroendocrine system, upregulated interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) of the immune system, and increased anxiety in rats. Compared with hyperbaric air, restraint tended to activate stronger stress responses. Conclusively, this work established a simulation stress model of the undersea environment induced by restraint, hyperbaric air and immersion. It further provided experimental data of such a model that showed significant activation of the CNS, neuroendocrine and immune systems and anxiety in rats.

The population included in the present analysis  is composed of crewmembers aboard 136 submarine patrols between January 1, 1997  and December 31, 1998. RESULTS: A total of 2,044 initial visits to medical staff  and 973 re-visits for the same condition were recorded during these patrols.  Potentially mission-impacting medical events reported among crewmembers were rare  (i.e., among a crew of 10 individuals, only 1-2 medical events would be expected  to occur during a 100 d-mission). The most common category of medical events was  injury, followed by respiratory illnesses (URIs), skin problems (minor  infections, ingrown toenail), symptoms and ill-defined conditions, digestive  disorders, infectious conditions, sensory organ problems (ear and eye), and  musculoskeletal conditions.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The stress effects induced by diverse military scenarios are usually studied under tightly controlled conditions, while only limited research has addressed realistic scenarios. This study was designed to compare the effects of two levels of realism in stressful training for escape from a sunken submarine. METHODS: Thirteen qualified submariners served as subjects. All had previously participated in underwater escape training using a simulated submarine in a land-based tank submerged at a depth of 6 m; for this study, they repeated the simulator escape, following which six of them executed escape from an actual submarine lying at a depth of 30 m on the sea floor. The men were studied before the exercises, immediately after surfacing, and 2 h later. Measured variables included sympathovagal balance, salivary cortisol, perceived mood, and sleep, as well as short-term and declarative memory. RESULTS: Compared to the simulator exercise in the tank, the escape at sea showed the following significant differences: 1) higher salivary cortisol values (6.33 +/- 3.9 nmol x L(-1) on shore and 13.38 +/- 7.5 nmol x L(-1) at sea); 2) greater adverse changes in mood, including vigor, tension, and ability to fall asleep; and 3) impairment in declarative memory. Responses were found to differ further for the five submariners who had prior experience of accident or injury while at sea. CONCLUSION: The psychophysiological and cognitive effects of military exercises may be influenced by the realism of conditions and by prior exposure to life-threatening situations.},

  abstract = {The submarine working and living environment is an isolated, confined, and extreme (ICE) environment where a continuous on-watch is required to fulfill the tactical objectives. The current study examined whether a physiological and behavioral adjustment to an operational watch standing scheme occurred in terms of hormonal secretion (i.e., melatonin and cortisol) and sleep during a 67-day undersea mission. The crew followed a strict scheme of watch-on blocks at 0:00-06:00 h and at 12:00-18:00 h (group 1, diurnal sleep group) or watch-on blocks at 06:00-12:00 h and 18:00-24:00 h (group 2, nocturnal sleep group). We sampled saliva during the operational blocks over a 24-h period at day 55 of the mission and collected sleep actigraphy data during the entire mission in 10 participants. Sleep showed a biphasic split pattern with significantly unequal distributions of total sleep time (TST) and sleep efficiency (SE) between the two sleeping blocks, i.e., one long and one short sleep bout. Melatonin secretion showed no adjustment at the end of the mission to the watch standing blocks, following an endogenous circadian rhythm independent from the social zeitgebers with indications of a phase shift. Cortisol secretion however matched the biphasic work-sleep shift routine. Human physiology does not fully obey operational needs and there are differences in adjustment between melatonin and cortisol. A watch standing schedule that provides a balance between physiology and operationality still needs to be established. The potential adaptation effects of bright light therapy and melatonin supplementation should be investigated in future research. NEW \& NOTEWORTHY The current study has a unique character due to the field context in which the data were collected. Data on long-term submarine missions are scarce and valuable in terms of operational and ecological validity. Moreover, the results are important both from a scientific and operational point of view, showing that human physiology does not fully obey operational needs and that there are differences in adjustment dependent from the type of circadian hormone.},

The authors used the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI)-2 to describe major patterns of psychopathology and abnormal personality functioning in a sample of 161 divers and 152 submariners and compared them with a sample of 139 general Navy employees. Navy divers and submariners displayed desirable mental health profiles, although occupational-specific markers of atypical behavior patterns were found, such as slightly elevated scores on the Hypomania scale among divers and on the Responsibility scale among submariners. There was a strong expression of masculine gender role identification among divers and submariners and the general Navy. In the cases in which atypical behavior dynamics occurred, it could be interpreted as adaptive rather than psychopathological in the specific context of the operational environment in which those individuals operated. Practically, this study provides contemporary MMPI-2 profiles and the accompanying occupational-related normative deviations for South African divers and submariners, possibly allowing for more accurate interpretation of profiles from these groups, resulting in enhanced mental health monitoring in these environments.},

To prepare for such emergencies, many navies provide training to master the procedures required to escape successfully from disabled submarines.

It further discusses applicable psychological constructs such as positive outcome expectancies, the role of anxiety, and other personal factors mediating outcomes of such training. It concludes with recommendations for future research aimed at enhancing the safety and impact of submarine escape training. These include enhanced detection of psychological risk factors such as anxiety, as well as investigating the relative contribution of personality variables to in-training safety and positive outcome expectancies. These recommendations do not only apply to submarine escape training, but may also be applicable to high fidelity safety training in other off-shore survival contexts, such as helicopter underwater escape training, freefall lifeboat training and smoke diving.},

The outcomes of the analysis, differently from the previously made conclusions, show that there was not a significant deviation of the rational choice of the players. We propose an extension of the method that includes monitoring of the nonverbal behavior of the players next to recording the game records. The method is focused on those aspects of psychological and sociological states that are crucial for the performance of the crew. In particular, we focus on measuring of emotional stress, initial signs of conflicts, trust, and ability to collaborate.},

  abstract = {Fatigue is a critically important aspect of crew endurance in submarine operations, with continuously high fatigue being associated with increased risk of human error and long-term negative health ramifications. Submarines pose several unique challenges to fatigue mitigation, including requirements for continuous manning for long durations, a lack of access to critical environmental zeitgebers (stimuli pertinent to circadian physiology; e. g., natural sunlight), and work, rest and sleep occurring within an encapsulated environment. In this paper, we examine the factors that underlie fatigue in such a context with the aim of evaluating the predictive utility of a biomathematical model (BMM) of fatigue. Three experience sampling studies were conducted with submarine crews using a participant-led measurement protocol that included assessments of subjective sleepiness, workload (NASA-Task Load Index [TLX] and a bespoke underload-overload scale), and sleep. As expected, results indicated that predicting KSS with a BMM approach outperformed more conventional linear modelling approaches (e.g., time-of-day, sleep duration, time awake). Both the homeostatic and circadian components of the BMM were significantly associated with KSS and used as controls in the workload models. We found increased NASA-TLX workload was significantly associated with increased average KSS ratings at the between-person level. However, counter to expectations, the two workload measures were not found to have significant linear or quadratic relationship with fatigue at the within-person level. An important outcome of the research is that applied fatigue researchers should be extremely cautious applying conventional linear predictors when predicting fatigue. Practical implications for the submarine and related extreme work context are discussed. Important avenues for continued research are outlined, including directly estimating BMM parameters.},

A psychoacoustic method, which is suitable for a small number of samples, was used. An optimal model with three common dimensions, specificities and latent classes was selected on the basis of the dissimilarity ratings among representative sounds and with the use of an extended version of the multidimensional scaling algorithm CLASCAL. However, such a three-dimensional space could not absolutely separate targets, whereas the first dimension in the four-dimensional space discriminated the submarines, patrol boats and ships; thus, the four-dimensional space was superior in target classification. The stepwise regression method was used to establish the relationships between individual dimensions and typical auditory features. Results showed that the first dimension was represented by the linear combination of zero-crossing rate and spectral variation, whereas the second dimension was described by attack slope. The last two dimensions were not associated with any features, and they were proved to include meaningless data noises. Finally, through a contrastive analysis, the perceptual space obtained in this study was found to be a good 'local' representation of the space in the first part of the study series.
